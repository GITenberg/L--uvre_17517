description: "L'œuvre is the fourteenth novel in the Rougon-Macquart series by Émile\
  \ Zola. It was first serialized in the periodical Gil Blas beginning in December\
  \ 1885 before being published in novel form by Charpentier in 1886.\nThe title,\
  \ translated literally as \"The Work\" (as in work of art), is often rendered in\
  \ English as The Masterpiece or His Masterpiece. It refers to the struggles of the\
  \ protagonist Claude Lantier to paint a great work reflecting his talent and genius.\n\
  L'œuvre is a fictional account of Zola's friendship with Paul Cézanne and a fairly\
  \ accurate portrayal of the Parisian art world in the mid 19th century. Zola and\
  \ Cézanne grew up together in Aix-en-Provence, the model for Zola's Plassans, where\
  \ Claude Lantier is born and receives his education. Like Cézanne, Claude Lantier\
  \ is a revolutionary artist whose work is misunderstood by an art-going public hidebound\
  \ by traditional subjects, techniques and representations. Many of the characteristics\
  \ ascribed to Claude Lantier are a compound taken from the lives of several impressionist\
  \ painters including Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, as well as Paul Cézanne. Zola's\
  \ self-portrait can be seen in the character of the novelist Pierre Sandoz.\nThe\
  \ book is often blamed for ending the friendship between Cézanne and Zola. The story\
  \ of a groundbreaking artist unable to live up to his potential must have seemed\
  \ intensely personal to Cézanne; no correspondence exists between the two after\
  \ a letter in which Cézanne thanks Zola for sending him the novel.\nThe novel covers\
  \ about 15 years, ending in 1870. Besides depicting the bohemian art world of 19th-century\
  \ Paris, L'œuvre explores the rise of Realism, Naturalism and Impressionism in painting.\
  \ Zola also looks at contemporary sculpture, literature, architecture, music and\
  \ journalism, as well as the commodification of art. In creating his portrayal of\
  \ the Parisian art world Zola includes several characters who are composites of\
  \ real-life art world related figures; artists, writers, art dealers, and friends\
  \ that he knew.\nL'œuvre was translated into English by Ernest A. Vizetelly in 1886\
  \ (reprinted by Barnes & Noble in 2006); other translations have appeared since.\
  \ One of the most readily accessible is that by Thomas Walton (1957), revised in\
  \ 1993 for Oxford World's Classics.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
